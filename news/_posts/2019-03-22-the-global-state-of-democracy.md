## EXPLORING DEMOCRACY’S RESILIENCE

This first edition of **[The Global State of Democracy](https://www.idea.int/gsod/)**, published by International IDEA in November 2017, explores current challenges to democracy and the enabling conditions for its resilience. As an intergovernmental organization that supports sustainable democracy worldwide, International IDEA defines democracy as a political system that is based on popular control and political equality. One of the Institute’s core principles is that democracy is a universal value for citizens and a globally owned concept for which there is no universally applicable model. Based on this definition, International IDEA has constructed new Global State of Democracy indices (GSoD indices) based on its State of Democracy assessment framework (a tool designed for in-country stakeholders to assess the quality of democracy). The indices were
developed by International IDEA staff with the support of external experts and the supervision of an expert advisory board consisting of five leading experts in the field of democracy measurement. The GSoD indices examine 155 countries over the period 1975–2015 and provide a diverse data set and evidence base for analysing global and regional trends. The GSoD indices data sets start in 1975 to ensure a high reliability and quality of secondary data sources. [Check it out here](https://www.idea.int/gsod/).

**[The Global State of Democracy (GSoD) In Focus](https://www.idea.int/publications/categories/gsod-in-focus)** series applies the GSoD Indices data to current issues, providing evidence-based analysis and insights into the contemporary democracy debate.
