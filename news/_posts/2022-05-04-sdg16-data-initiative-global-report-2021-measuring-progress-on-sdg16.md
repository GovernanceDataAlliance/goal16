The **SDG16 Data Initiative** is proud to launch our [2021 Annual Global Report](https://www.idea.int/sites/default/files/news/news-pdfs/SDG16DI%20Global%20Report%202021%20FINAL.pdf)! The SDG16 Data Initiative Global Report series aims to evaluate global progress towards realizing the 2030 Agendaâ€™s promise of peaceful, just and inclusive societies. The Global Report provides governments, UN officials, and civil society stakeholders with a resource to help understand progress on SDG16 targets and an evidence base for them to identify gaps and shortcomings in both implementing and monitoring SDG16.

The SDG16 Data Initiative is a consortium dedicated to promoting non-official data on the implementation and tracking of progress toward the targets that comprise the UN-adopted Sustainable Development Goal 16 on achieving peaceful, inclusive and just societies by 2030. The 2021 SDG16 Data Initiative Global Report is a resource on civil society methodologies designed to measure progress on SDG 16 targets and indicators.
