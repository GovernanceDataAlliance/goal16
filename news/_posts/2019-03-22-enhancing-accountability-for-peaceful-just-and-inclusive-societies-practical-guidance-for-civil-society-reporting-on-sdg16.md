## Practical guidance for civil society reporting on SDG16+

Since 2015, Saferworld has worked with civil society and governments to translate the 2030 Agenda commitments to peaceful, just and inclusive societies into action.

For the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved, governments and other stakeholders must be accountable for the commitments agreed in 2015. Reporting by civil society on national progress towards the SDGs is critical for ensuring accountability, and provides an important complement to official accounts of progress.

[This briefing](https://www.saferworld.org.uk/resources/publications/1201-enhancing-accountability-for-peaceful-just-and-inclusive-societies-practical-guidance-for-civil-society-reporting-on-sdg16) provides practical guidance for civil society organisations to develop independent reports on progress towards the goal of peaceful, just and inclusive societies, referred to as SDG16+. The guidance is in two parts: the first outlines a series of steps for developing a report, and the second proposes a structure for the reportâ€™s content.
