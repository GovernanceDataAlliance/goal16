The SDG16 is particularly challenging for open data collection. Non-official data, as highlighted by SDG16 Data Initiative (SDG16 DI), independently address gaps in data availability, through innovative methodologies and can reduce capacity strain on NGOs through strategic partnerships. Critically, non-official data can provide accountability to governments, ensuring perceptions and needs of marginalized groups are accounted for.

This session will advance monitoring and implementing SDG16 with new data and guidance for policymakers and civil society.  More information on the event is included in the attached invitation.

The event will be webcast live at [http://webtv.un.org/](http://webtv.un.org/)
