The **SDG16 Data Initiative** is proud to launch our **2022 Annual Global Report**. The report, jointly produced by the SDG16 Data Initiative consortium, aims to evaluate global progress towards realizing Sustainable Development Goal 16 - Promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development – presenting the latest evidence. In addition, as we are near the halfway point for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the report constitutes a moment for reflection and clarification of priorities for all actors involved in this collaborative pursuit.

The UN-adopted SDG16 is a cornerstone of the overall agenda. Promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, ensuring access to justice for all and building effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels are critical threshold conditions for development. SDG16 is built upon the premise that democracy, peace, and sustainable development are inseparable: democracy is essential for sustainable development.

This year’s report suggests that it is looking increasingly unlikely for many of the SDG16 indicators to meet key targets. While some progress has been made indicators such as access to justice, restrictions to civil society and democratic accountability have seen declines, or at best are stagnant. Democratic erosion, protracted conflict, armed violence and inequality are factors that have contributed to these declines.
There is a need for renewed focus on preventing ‘democratic decline’, protecting civil society organizations and media professionals involved in the increasingly high-risk work of defending media freedom, protecting human rights and providing access to justice.
