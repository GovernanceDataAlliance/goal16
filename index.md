## The SDG16 Data Initiative

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted unanimously by the 193 United Nations Member States in September 2015 to guide global and national development policies to 2030.

SDG16 commits all countries to:

**“Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels”**

Achieving SDG16 - and all 17 goals - will require unprecedented problem solving and mobilization of governments, businesses, and civil society. The SDG16 Data Initiative is a collective project to compile existing global data that can help track progress towards the achievement of SDG16. The recommended UN official indicators along with proposed complementary indicators are listed for each target. We have included a variety of respected data providers and sought to highlight gaps and useful alternative data sources in SDG16 target areas.

Explore, compare and share!
