This page provides detailed information on all of the indicators and sources used in the SDG16 Data Initiative.

The [Inter-agency Expert Group on SDG Indicators](http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/) (IAEG-SDGs) has identified 23 global indicators for SDG16â€™s 12 targets. Where possible, we have sought to find existing data sources for these global indicators. Often, these sources are the ones referenced in the [metadata](http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-16.pdf) compiled by the IAEG-SDGs. We have also included complementary indicators which we believe provide additional insight into the target and/or make up for gaps in data availability for the global indicators.

Data for all the indicators are based on both official data sources, such as the World Bank or UN agencies that compile country statistics, and unofficial data sources, including civil society and polling organizations. Data sources have been selected that cover the most countries and which are from respected data providers with robust methodologies.

This page will be updated as new data become available and new indicators are added to the dashboard. We welcome your thoughts! Please send comments and suggestions to [SDG16DataInitiative@gmail.com](SDG16DataInitiative@gmail.com).
