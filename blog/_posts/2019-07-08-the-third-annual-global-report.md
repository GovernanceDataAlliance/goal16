The **SDG16 Data Initiative** is proud to launch our third **Annual Global Report**! The SDG16 Data Initiative Global Report series aims to evaluate global progress towards realizing the 2030 Agenda’s promise of peaceful, just and inclusive societies. The Global Report provides governments, UN officials, and civil society stakeholders with a resource to help understand progress on SDG16 targets and an evidence base for them to identify gaps and shortcomings in both implementing and monitoring SDG16.

The 2019 Global Report covers all twelve targets, creating the critical baseline of available data necessary for future substantive analysis. The 2019 Global Report, prepared in light of SDG16’s initial review at the 2019 High-Level Political Forum (HLPF), assess progress made on all twelve targets. Through this review, the 2019 Global Report aims to provide policymakers and civil society actors with pathways forward to improve both SDG16 implementation and data coverage.
