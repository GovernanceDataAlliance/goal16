## The WJP Rule of Law Index® is the world’s leading source for original data on the rule of law. 

The [WJP Rule of Law Index](https://worldjusticeproject.org/our-work/research-and-data/wjp-rule-law-index-2019)® relies on more than 120,000 household and 3,800 expert surveys to measure how the rule of law is experienced and perceived in practical, everyday situations by the general public in 126 countries. Performance is measured using 44 indicators across eight primary rule of law factors, each of which is scored and ranked globally and against regional and income peers: Constraints on Government Powers, Absence of Corruption, Open Government, Fundamental Rights, Order and Security, Regulatory Enforcement, Civil Justice, and Criminal Justice. 

To complement the 2019 Rule of Law Index report, the WJP is also releasing its first Rule of Law Index® Insights analysis of key rule of law trends. This analysis shows that more countries declined than improved in overall rule of law performance for the second year in a row, continuing a negative slide toward weaker rule of law around the world. The analysis also provides a more in-depth look factor-level changes, rule of law changes over four years, regional developments in Africa and Europe, and trends in authoritarianism.
