The SDG16 Data Initiative is proud to launch our third annual Global Report! The SDG16 Data Initiative Global Report series aims to evaluate global progress towards realizing the 2030 Agendaâ€™s promise of peaceful, just and inclusive societies. The Global Report provides governments, UN officials, and civil society stakeholders with a resource to help understand progress on SDG16 targets and an evidence base for them to identify gaps and shortcomings in both implementing and monitoring SDG16.
