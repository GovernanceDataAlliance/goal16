Summary of Side-Event

## The Critical Role of Non-Official Data in Monitoring and Implementing SDG16

### 28 May 2019, 12:30-14:00

**Background on the event**

The side-event was promoted by the SDG16 Data Initiative (DI), launched in July 2016 by a consortium of 14 partner organizations  that seeks to support the open and holistic tracking of the commitments made by all 193 UN Member States captured in SDG16. The SDG16 DI was created to respond to the gap in terms of comprehensive data on SDG16 issues, especially civil society generated data, open global monitoring and improved availability of data for civil society actors. The partnership created and maintains an interactive website (www.sdg16.org).

**Issues discussed**

- The side-event stressed the importance of perception and experience-based indicators in a people-centred agenda, to mainstream gender and diversity and leave no one behind. It provided an opportunity to present preliminary results of the SDG16 DI 2019 Annual Report, that will be issued in July 2019, with examples on targets 16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.6, 16.7 and 16.10.
- The value of a partnerships which combines expertise and experiences of the different communities of practice that work on SDG16 (peace, justice and accountable institutions) in order to contribute to complementing official indicators with non-official data, so as to capture important and often neglected dimensions of SDG16 targets.
- The need to invest in country-level data on the basis of an understanding of the particular ecosystem of official and non-official indicators on SDG16.
- The need to build partnerships and engage both data producers and data users in this conversation.

**Key recommendations for action**

- Non-official data sources should be included alongside official data sources in the global, regional and national monitoring of SDG16 implementation.
- Expanding the members of civil society - especially those representing local and marginalized voices - who understand and engage with SDG16 and its targets, indicators and data.
- The official indicators should both retain tier III indicators, that have not yet an agreed methodology, and add additional indicators that meet quality standards and more accurately reflect the objectives of the targets.
- Member states, NSOs and UN custodian agencies should accept the role of civil society non-official innovative methodologies, data and resources, which should be integrated into monitoring processes. Custodian agencies for different indicators should be required to come up with clear methodologies for assessing whether States have achieved those indicators.
